A calculator can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code defines the structure of the calculator, including the display area and buttons. 
The CSS code styles the calculator, including the size, color, and layout of the display area and buttons.
The JavaScript code adds functionality to the buttons, allowing the user to input numbers, perform arithmetic operations, and display the results.
The calculator can handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The user can input numbers by clicking on the buttons, and the calculator will display the result when the equals button is clicked.
The calculator can also clear the display by clicking on the clear button.
